# Cover Letters

While cover letters aren’t the most common in the tech industry, there are still several situations where you might need to write one. Aside from tech, you may be considering larger corporations or nonprofits where they’re more common. An online application may indicate that it’s optional, but you’ll want to submit one to stand out from the pack. Maybe a recruiter asks you to email them your resume. In a case like this you’re not just going to forward your resume along with a blank email. 

So, yes, even though you’re a programmer, you’re probably going to have to write a cover letter at some point. Cover letters are a great way for employers to assess your written communication skills and to see if you know the standard practices for submitting a cover letter. Just because you’re going for a job where you’ll write code for much of the day doesn’t mean that you won’t be communicating with colleagues and clients daily (usually by email or Slack). Demonstrate that you have sound writing skills and can get your points across in a coherent and friendly manner. Some people skip this step entirely and those people are often looked at as less serious about getting the job. You want to go above and beyond as a jobseeker, so write your cover letters!  

## The Basics of a Cover Letter

Your cover letter is the place where you connect the dots on your resume—it’s not where you repeat your resume bullets word for word. Of course, you’ll need to include some information about your background, but your main goal is to show what you have to offer and why you’re interested in the company.

**Note that we said "show" and not "tell."** Rather than stating your proficiency level in Ruby, show it off with a story on your latest project. Connect your project’s results to the kind of work you’d like to do for the company you’re applying to. You want to be precise about the kind of value you can bring and how it directly relates to what the company is looking for.

*When thinking about how formal your language should be** take a cue from the way the company presents itself on its website. If it’s a large corporation with professional language on its site, write your cover letter accordingly. For smaller companies and startups with casual language on their sites, use a more conversational tone.

**On formatting:** If you’re submitting a traditional cover letter to a more established company, go ahead and use the standard address-on-top letter formatting. For startups, it’s your preference. Your candidacy likely won’t be impacted either way if you keep the address-on-top letter formatting. However, if you’re writing a cover in the body of an email, skip it. Regardless of what kind of company you’re writing to, avoid addressing your reader with, “To Whom It May Concern,” or “Dear Sir or Madam.” Ideally, find the name of the hiring manager or, if that’s not possible, go ahead and use something like, “Dear Hiring Manager,” or “Hello Team [Company Name].” 

**So, what does all that look like in order?** In your first paragraph, start with what is essentially your elevator pitch and then go into why you’re in love with the company (we’re not kidding here -- you need to emphasize why this company interests you, and do it with energy). 

The bulk of your second or third paragraphs will be focused on your illustrating how you can create value for the company. This is a good place where you can highlight specific accomplishments from past work experiences or special accolades that may correlate with the skills necessary to do job. Additionally, if you’ve worked in the same industry in your previous career (e.g. you did marketing for healthcare companies in the past, and now you want to be a developer at a health-tech startup), this is a great place to tie your understanding of the industry with your desire to contribute in a new way.

Finally, wrap it up with your hope to continue the conversation in an interview and how they can reach you. You can pose that type of question by saying something like “I’d welcome the opportunity to talk with you and your team about that work you’re doing at COMPANY X. I’m available for an introductory call or meeting and would be happy to work around your schedule. Thanks in advance for your time.“ If your phone number and email address are already written under your name it’s not necessary to repeat them again in this line. 

As a final note, know that it’s not necessary to indent paragraphs anymore but skip a line between paragraphs. And your cover letter shouldn’t be more than a page. 

## How to Stand Out

Now that you know the basics, here’s how to kick it up a notch. A great cover letter uses an authentic voice and shows off what you know about the company rather than generic sounding language that can be submitted for any job application. 

When you’re explaining your interest in a company, get specific. Do your research (which we cover in two different lessons in the interviewing unit) and show that you know what you’re signing up for. If you can swap out the name of the company and replace it with another company and your cover letter still makes sense, then it’s not nearly specific enough. This point cannot be overstated: it’s incredibly important and can set you apart from other candidates to show your passion for the company and interest in the role.

Here are a couple good examples of strong cover letter lines with unique voices that also illustrate their knowledge of the company in subtle ways:

* I recently took a BuzzFeed quiz that told me I should be a jetfighter pilot. I don’t know about that, but it did get me thinking: a position that combines my extensive experience in the airline industry with my Flatiron School approved programming skills would be perfection.

* It was my pug, Lori, who inspired me to check out the software developer opening (she’s psyched about the idea of sharing an office with me every day) and as I learned more about what [pet startup] is doing to transform the pet healthcare space, I couldn’t help but give her a deluxe treat for helping me find my dream company.

## Conclusion 

In your concluding paragraph, you want to restate your interest and value in the role and let the employer know that you’re available to talk/meet in the near future, and make sure your phone and email are somewhere in the document. 

The most important takeaway from this lesson should be that employers care about how you write. Even though you’re starting a new role as a technologist, you should expect to communicate constantly with colleagues, so show your competency via your cover letter.  Sure, cover letters aren’t always necessary but you should always strive to go above and beyond whenever you can. Always proofread, and don’t ever copy and paste a cover letter and send it to multiple companies (the same way you’d never send the same thank you note to multiple employees at a company after interviewing with them). 

## Assignment- Cover Letters

Create a Google doc. Remember to retitle it ""Your Name" + Cover Letters"

For this assignment we aren’t going to make you write a complete cover letter. Instead, choose 3 companies that interest you and write an opening cover letter section for each one, showing you’ve done your research, know the company’s voice/tone, and makes you stand out.

Fill out the Google Doc with the above opening sections. 

**Submit** your resume to careerprep@flatironschool.com. Remember in the subject line to include your name and this specific assignment.

In this case, your email subject line will be “”Your Name” + Cover Letters”

In the body of your email again include:
>Your Name
